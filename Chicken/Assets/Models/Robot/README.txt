In Unity:

After dragging the peppermodel.fbx into the Scene.

Find the material for the pepper.

Attach the PepperUVLayout5_meitu_4 onto the material parameter "Albedo".

There are six animations included: the first four are positive poses, while the rest are negative.

The animations are performed on the same timeline, in order to use them seperately, you need to set different "start" and "end" nodes.
